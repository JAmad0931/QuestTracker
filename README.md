# QuestTracker
Spring 2023 Semester:

Goal was to create a tracker for quests, in which one could add quests as well as keep track of those quests. This was the first project I undertook in which the 
sklls learned in the class were applied and it was also a team based project, so I worked with other developers through the use of Github.
